	Hi, my name is Rolando Cabrera. First of all I'm fortunate enough to be a father and have an amazing family. My wife and children have been very supportive of all my endeavors. I'm currently employed at Valley Teen Ranch where I work as an awake night staff child care worker. There I provide for residents overall care and safety. However, I also enjoy being around computers and I am super excited to be a part of Geekwise Academy. Bootcamp 1 has introduced me to the exciting world of web developing and so far, all of my experiences have been challenging but rewarding. This website is intended to demonstrate everything that I've learned so far in web developing by demonstrating a practical yet functional website. I've provided a webfolio of my works. I would like to thank Mr. James Cha for giving us his time and expertise, and all my wonderful colleagues at Bitwise!!! See you soon!!!
